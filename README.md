# draggr

[draggr](https://artemdru.github.io/draggr) is a drag-and-drop personal scheduling tool that allows you to easily and quickly lay out a schedule for your day by dropping tasks onto a calendar. You can complete, rearrange, or resize your tasks as your day goes as planned, or not as planned - all in a very visual depiction of your plan for the day, with task sizes corresponding to the time it takes to complete them.

The idea of centering a scheduler around drag-and-drop and resize functionality comes from a want to intuitively divide my day into easily visible and editable chunks - both for organization, and for gamification of productivity.
